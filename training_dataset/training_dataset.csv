The only issue with the concurrent map as I wrote earlier is that the specification does not offer any guarantee on its put/get time (all it says is that it is functionally spec is the same as Hashtable). It is a bit unfortunate that we cannot use a c-o-w map (which would otherwise be ideal for metrics because intuitively you typically wouldn‚Äôt expect metrics to get a lot of sudden inserts from request handler threads) but quotas changes that. In fact an alternate would be to just use a simple HashMap (which does offer constant-time under most circumstances) and surround all operations on it with a read/write lock as appropriate.

This way you would duplicate the least amount of code. Otherwise, you would take the exact code in the DataSet removeVertices and duplicate it in difference. That's not very practical IMO.Also, it may occur that a user has a DataSet of elements to remove. An extra removeVertices won't really hurt then, would it?

"@SinghAsDev Another problem that @guozhangwang and I briefly talked about was whether we should augment the Metadata object to support getting metadata for all topics (with a hook to get a notification when there is a change)*. Your approach is exactly the one I had in mind, but it does result in a little more overhead since metadata refreshes are done both in KafkaConsumer and in NetworkClient. The nice thing about separating them is that it lets you refresh the full metadata list less frequently. If your regex only covers a small set of the topics, then that makes ""normal"" metadata refreshes cheaper and they can be done more often. However, it seems a little questionable whether this capability is actually useful in practice, so reducing the metadata overhead might be the bigger win. What do you think? ",0,3,0,0,21,5,0

"> If a request is received for an unknown protocol request type, or for an unsupported version of a known type, the broker should respond with an empty response only including the common Length+CorrId header with Length=0, instead of closing the connection. The effect of this empty message received by the client is that the client will fail to parse the response (since it will expect a proper non-empty reply) and throw an error to the application with the correct context - that of a protocol parsing failure for request type XYZ. All existing clients should be able to handle this gracefully without any alterations to the code, while updated clients supporting the proposals in this KIP can handle the empty response accordingly by returning a ""Request not supported by server"" error the application. The level of detail in the returned error message to the application naturally varies between client implementations but is still by far better than a closed connection which says nothing of the underlying error.",0,3,0,0,18,5,0

"@SinghAsDev Haha, I can understand why this is a little confusing, but the network layer considers the request a ""success"" if it gets a response. However, that doesn't mean that there wasn't an error code in that response. It might be nice to handle this at the network layer, but it seems to me that there wasn't a generic way to check for errors. Each response object had the error code at a different location in its schema, so the only thing we could do is pass the response back and let the application determine if there was an error. The one case where we might be able to infer errors generically is by checking ClientResponse.wasDisconnected(), but I don't think we do this either (I've forgotten if there's a good reason for that).",0,1,0,0,17,4,1
